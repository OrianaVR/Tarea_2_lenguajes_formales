## üìò Description
This project implements the algorithm for **eliminating left recursion** from a *Context-Free Grammar (CFG)*, as described in *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools* by **Aho et al. (Section 4.3.3)**.  

For each case, the program prints an **equivalent grammar without left recursion**, following the same format as the input.

The implementation supports **any valid CFG**, not just the examples from the assignment.

## üöÄ Instructions for Running the Implementation

1. **Ensure a working installation of Python 3.**

2. **Save the code** in a file named `main.py`.

3. **Run from Terminal:**  
   Open a terminal (or Visual Studio Code terminal) inside the project folder and execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py
4. **Enter your input manually**, following this strict format:

   - **Line 1:** A number `n > 0` indicating the total number of cases.  
   - For each case:  
     - A line with a natural number `k > 0`, representing the number of nonterminals (`k = |N|`).  
     - Then `k` lines, each with a production rule in the format:  

       ```
       <nonterminal> -> <derivation alternatives separated by spaces>
       ```

   When you finish typing the grammar press enter to see the results

**4** : The program will print the equivalent grammar without left recursion for each case, following the same format as the input. A single line break is printed between cases.

### üß© Example
   ```
   **Input:**
3
1
S -> Sa b
2
S -> Aa b
A -> Ac Sd m
2
S -> Sa Ab
A -> Ac Sc c
       ```

      ```
**Output:**
S -> bZ
Z -> aZ e

S -> Aa b
A -> bdZ mZ
Z -> cZ adZ e

S -> AbZ
A -> cY
Z -> aZ e
Y -> cY bZcY e
       ```

## üóé About input.txt:

A file named input.txt is included in the repository only as an example to show the expected input format and content.
‚ö†Ô∏è The program does not automatically read from this file ‚Äî the user must enter the grammar manually when executing main.py.

## Algorithm Explanation
**1.** The algorithm establishes a fixed order for all nonterminals, $N = \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k\}$, and processes them in this sequence. When nonterminal $A_i$ is processed, the algorithm ensures that all left recursion involving $A_i$ and any preceding nonterminal $A_j$ ($j < i$) is completely removed.

**2.** For a nonterminal $A_i$, the code iterates through all $A_j$ where $j < i$. If a production is of the form $A_i \rightarrow A_j \gamma$, this production is replaced. The substitution involves taking all current productions of $A_j$ and substituting them back into $A_i$, resulting in new productions of the form. This step guarantees that $A_i$ will not start with any nonterminal $A_j$ that precedes it in the established order.

**3.** Once the substitution is complete, $A_i$ may only have direct left recursion, meaning productions of the form $A_i \rightarrow A_i \alpha \mid \beta$. The strings $\beta$ are the non-recursive alternatives (those not starting with $A_i$), and the strings $\alpha$ are the trailing sequences of the recursive productions. To eliminate this direct recursion, a new nonterminal ($A'$, which is sequentially named $Z, Y, X, \dots$ in the code to comply with the single capital letter requirement) is introduced.
